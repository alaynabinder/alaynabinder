Hi 👋 My name is Alayna Binder
===============================

Data Scientist
---------------------------

I'm currently a Statistics and Computer Science student at Duke University, graduating May 2026, with concentrations in AI/ML and Data Science. With a deep fascination for both the theory behind models and their hands-on applications, I aim to build solutions that are as practical as they are innovative. My experience in social media and communications has shaped a people-centered approach, allowing me to prioritize user needs and meaningful impact. Passionate about social good, I strive to use data-driven solutions to create positive change, bringing a user-centered mindset to all my work.
